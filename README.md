# Speedracer_rl
With a little bit of the Chemical X and the sweat from the brows of Jaime, Henry and Casey, we will create the best RL trackmania racer.


## FILES:
#### DQN.py
#CURRENT DUMB IMPLEMENTATION OF DQN, use epsilon greedy to get actions. 

#### Training_loop.py
WORK IN PROGRESS

## TEST/UTIL files
#### inf_time_test.py
Look into the number of parameters we can reasonably put on a computer before we end up with unreasonable inference. Obviously depends on the hardware we are using.

#### trackmania_env_test.py
Given a random policy we can see if the current connection between our TMRL and openplanet works.
